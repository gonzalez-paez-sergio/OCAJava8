/**
 * <pre>
 * Things to remember
 *
 * 1. Unless overridden with parenthesis, Java operator follow order of operation by decreasing
 * order of precedence. if 2 operators have the same level of precedence then java guarantee left to
 * right evaluation
 *
 * 2. Casting primitives is required anytime you go from a larger numerical data type into  a
 * smaller one
 *
 * 3. Overflow is when a number is so large that it will no longer fit  within the data type, so the
 * system "wraps around" to the next lowest value and counts up from there. Thereâ€™s also an
 * analogous underflow, when the number is too low to fit in  the data type.
 *
 * 4. when using the assignment operator, the result of the assignment is an expression in and of
 * itself, equal to the value of the assignment
 *
 * 5. For object comparison the equality operator is applied to references to the objects, not the objects they point to
 * </pre>
